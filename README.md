# Sentiment

Introducing the better Yelp - Sentiment!

Sentiment utilizes the sentiment analysis ability of new LLM's to judge public opinion on any business you want!

How this works:
By supplying a business name and address, social media posts, review websites, etc. are scraped for user reviews of the business. These reviews are put into a model finetuned on this type of data in order to provide a score for the company based on the sentiment of the reviews. The model also provides common positives and negatives found in the reviews.

The code provided only covers the frontend. The model and scraping techniques will stay in the closet for now :P

Please feel free to reach out with advice, questions, or a simple hello!
